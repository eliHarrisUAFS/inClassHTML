            <p1>The HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is the backbone of the
                World Wide Web. It's the protocol that powers your web browsing
                experience, allowing your browser to fetch web pages, images,
                videos, and other resources from servers all around the globe.
                HTTP is an application layer protocol that facilitates the
                communication between clients (usually web browsers) and web
                servers. It works seamlessly with other protocols like TCP/IP to
                ensure the reliable delivery of data.</p1>

            <h1>How Does HTTP Work?</h1>
            <p1>When you enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into your
                browser's address bar and hit Enter, your browser initiates an
                HTTP request to the server hosting that URL. Here's a simplified
                overview of the process:</p1>

            <ul type="1">
                <li id="li_one">Browser Request:</li>
                <dd>
                    <p>Your browser sends an HTTP request to
                        the server, specifying the resource it wants (e.g., a
                        webpage).</p>
                </dd>

                <li id="li_one">Server Response:</li>
                <dd>
                    <p>The web server processes the request
                        and sends back an HTTP response, which includes the
                        requested resource's data.</p>
                </dd>
                <li id="li_one">Displaying Content:</li>
                <dd><p>Your browser receives the response
                        and renders the webpage for you to view.</p>
                </dd>
            </ul>
